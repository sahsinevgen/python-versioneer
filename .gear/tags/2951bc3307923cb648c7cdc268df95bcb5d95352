Release 0.29 (7-Jul-2023)

This release allows for `pyproject.toml`-only build systems to allow versioneer to find
the project root, despite an absense of a `setup.py`. Provides some error message support
when the pyproject.toml is malformed. Finally we added basic type-hinting to the project,
which should help users of type-checking systems ensure correct code when vendoring.

With thanks to Dimitri Papadopoulos Orfanos, Mike Taves, '@gamecss' and '@GCS-ZHN' for contributions.
